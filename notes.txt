Algorithm
--------
pseudocode:
attemptMove function (input = square)
	check if square is empty. if so,
		write the symbol of the 'current player'
		draw the "undo" button
		check if game is over. if so, 
			name winner (could be stalemate)
			give person option to start over
		if not,
			toggle "current player" value
	if not,
		say something like "you can't play there!"
		
current player:
	symbol = X or O
	

--------
Architecture
--------
Need to keep track of a current player
To start game: "Play a friend or play a computer?
Need a way to reset or re-start game at any given time
Need a way to set "winner" (either X, O, no one, or null)
Need a way of displaying messages like "You can't do that!" or "X is the winner!"
Need a "virtual board" that talks to the graphical (html) board (so I don't have to iterate over the DOM every time I want to check if a move is valid or if the game is over)
Would be nice if the AI had a "thinking..." timer
A cool Easter egg would be to have a button that says "i give up" and show a message like "the only winning move is not to play" alluding to that 80's movie with nuclear program AIs...

Methods
--------
checkGameOver: looks at board, returns bool of true or false
